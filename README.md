Doorman DigitalOcean Action
===========================

This Github action allows you to open or close an specific port in your DigitalOcean firewall.
It's really useful for deploy in your instances from Github Actions, as [they don't provide a list of IPs to add to your security groups](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/virtual-environments-for-github-hosted-runners#ip-addresses-of-github-hosted-runners).

Usage
-----
You need to generate a **personal access token** from [your DigitalOcean Applications & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens) page.

Copy that token, and paste in the secrets of your repo:

Create or update a workflow, adding the file `.github/workflows/doorman.yml` ([more info about how to use Github Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/starting-with-preconfigured-workflow-templates)).


```yaml

############################
## prepare your artifacts ##
############################

- name: Doorman open
  uses: patoroco/doorman@master
  with:
    digitaloceanToken: ${{ secrets.DO_TOKEN }}
    firewallName: "name_of_the_firewall"
    actionToDo: "add"
    dryRun: false

############################
## deploy to DigitalOcean ##
############################

- name: Doorman close
  uses: patoroco/doorman@master
  with:
    digitaloceanToken: ${{ secrets.DO_TOKEN }}
    firewallName: "name_of_the_firewall"
    actionToDo: "remove"
    dryRun: false
```

To check that everything is working as expected, you have to push these changes to your repo, and a new build in the `Actions` tab should be starting.


Development
-----------
First of all, you have to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

I've been using [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) to test the action in local, and it's really useful because it doesn't require to push anything to github.
To use it, you only need to run the `pack` script, which will create the `dist/index.js`, and run the action with `act`:

```bash
npm run pack && act -j local -s DO_TOKEN
```

You can also run the code itself using:

```bash
ts-node src/main.ts
```
